# Deep-Learning-Mini-Project

## Introduction/ Description

The task of natural language understanding and in particular question answering has become more
important in the recent history. Assistants like Amazonâ€™s Alexa and other powerful questionanswering
systems, especially search engines, make use of this technology to enhance functionality
and thus improving usability for the human end-user. In the past often hand-crafted features and rulebased
learners were used for detecting the information in a natural language text. With achievements
in machine learning, especially with novel deep learning techniques, the performance and accuracy
with reference to this task improved heavily. Todays approaches among others include the usage of
word embeddings, Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neuronal Networks. Therefore this
report deals with a recent and promising work on question answering with deep learning techniques.
Also extensions and reflections on the previously mentioned approach will be given regarding
improvement and comparison of different techniques.
